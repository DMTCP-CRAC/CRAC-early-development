// Helper class to save and restore context (in particular, the FS register),
// when switching between the upper half and the lower half. In the current
// design, the caller would generally be the upper half, trying to jump into
// the lower half. An example would be calling a real function defined in the
// lower half from a function wrapper defined in the upper half.
// Example usage:
//   int function_wrapper()
//   {
//     SwitchContext ctx;
//     return _real_function();
//   }
// The idea is to leverage the C++ language semantics to help us automatically
// restore the context when the object goes out of scope.
